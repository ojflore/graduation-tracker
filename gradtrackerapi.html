  <h2>Graduation Tracker API Documentation</h2>
  This API is for the <b>PPU Graduation Tracker</b> utility. This utility can be used by prospective and current PPU Students to track their courses and create mock class schedules. When you include gradtracker.js, a global variable is created called gradtracker. All methods should be called on this object. For example, we can add a course to the scheduler by using <b>gradtracker.addCourse("SP 18", "CMPS 160")</b> Below you can find the API:<br><br>
  <table>
    <tr><td>Method Name</td><td>Parameters</td><td>Return Value</td></td><td>Description</td></tr>
	<tr><td>gradtracker.getCatalog()</td><td>Calls the function in gradtracker.js that returns the object in the catalog.</td><td>None</td></td><td>This method allows a user to <b>view</b> a specific course and it's description to include prerequisites in the catalog by term.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>gradtracker.getSchedule()</td><td>Calls the function in gradtracker.js that returns the object in the schedule.</td><td>None</td></td><td>This method allows a user to <b>select</b> a course based on the term they have selected. Each term only allows for the selection of certain (available) courses.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>gradtracker.addCourse()</td><td>Calls the function in gradtracker.js that adds the object to the schedule.</td><td>None</td></td><td>This method allows a user to <b>add</b> a course based on the term they have selected to the schedule.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>listen(cb)</td><td><i>cb:</i> is the callback function.

This allows the UI to be updated when the model changes.</td></tr>
